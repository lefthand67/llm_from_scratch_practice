"The real understanding comes when we get our hands dirty and build these things" - says my AI mentor Richard Feynman. 

I use my own mentor prompt generated with the help from my another prompt ["mentor_generator"](https://github.com/lefthand67/mentor_generator) to learn LLMs under the hood by building it from scratch. The idea stems from the [Stanford CS336 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_) but this course is interactive though it needs hallucination checks.

I run my mentor in free DeepSeek chat in no reasoning mode (the system prompt is already too heavy). I am excited to see where this experiment will lead me to.
